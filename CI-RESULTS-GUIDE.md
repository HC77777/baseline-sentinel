## Troubleshooting

### "No artifact found"
- Make sure the CI workflow completed
- Check that it didn't fail in the build step
- The artifact is only available for 90 days

### "Invalid JSON format"
- Make sure you downloaded the correct file
- Don't edit the JSON manually
- Re-download if corrupted

### "Cannot find file"
- The JSON might be in a ZIP file
- Extract it first
- Look for `baseline-results.json`
