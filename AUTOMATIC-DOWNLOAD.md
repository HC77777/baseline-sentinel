# 🚀 Automatic CI Results Download

## ✨ What Changed?

**Before:** Click "Import Results" → Get blank field → Download file from GitHub → Select file manually  
**Now:** Click "Import Results" → **Automatically downloads from GitHub!** → Shows results instantly!

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Option 1: Auto-Sync (Polling) - **Recommended**

**Once you enable auto-sync:**

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Wait for CI to finish (~1-2 minutes)
3. **You get a notification:** "🔔 New CI scan completed! Click to automatically download and import results."
4. **Click "Import Now"**
5. **Done!** Results appear automatically in VS Code! ✨

**Zero manual downloads. Zero file pickers. One click!**

---

### Option 2: Manual Import (Also Automatic!)

**If you don't have auto-sync enabled:**

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Wait for CI to finish
3. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`)
4. Run: `Baseline Sentinel: Import CI Scan Results`
5. **VS Code automatically:**
   - Connects to GitHub
   - Finds your latest workflow run
   - Downloads the artifact
   - Extracts the JSON
   - Shows the results!

**Still zero manual downloads!**

---

## 🔑 Requirements

To use automatic download, you need a **GitHub token** (same one used for auto-sync).

### If You Don't Have a Token Yet:

When you click "Import Results", you'll see:
```
⚠️ GitHub token not configured. Auto-download requires a token.
[Set Up Token] [Manual Import] [Cancel]
```

**Click "Set Up Token"** and follow the prompts. Takes 2 minutes!

Or read the full guide: **[GITHUB-TOKEN-GUIDE.md](GITHUB-TOKEN-GUIDE.md)**

## 🛠️ Behind the Scenes

When you click "Import Now", here's what happens:

```
1. VS Code reads your Git remote URL
   └─ Detects: HC77777/sample-web-app

2. Calls GitHub API to get latest workflow runs
   └─ Finds: "Baseline Sentinel" workflow (completed 2 min ago)

3. Gets the artifacts list from that run
   └─ Finds: "baseline-results" artifact

4. Downloads the ZIP file
   └─ Saves to: /tmp/baseline-artifact-123456789.zip

5. Extracts baseline-results.json from ZIP
   └─ Parses the JSON data

6. Shows you the results
   └─ "Found 18 issues in 3 files. Review and fix?"
   
7. Cleans up temp file
   └─ Deletes the ZIP
```

**All of this happens in ~2-3 seconds!** 🚀

## 🎬 Complete Workflow Examples

### Example 1: With Auto-Sync (Best Experience)

```
10:00 AM - You: Write code with backdrop-filter
10:05 AM - You: git push
10:06 AM - GitHub: CI starts
10:08 AM - GitHub: CI completes, uploads artifact
10:08 AM - VS Code: 🔔 "New CI scan completed!"
10:08 AM - You: Click "Import Now"
10:08 AM - VS Code: ⚙️ "Downloading CI results..." (2 seconds)
10:08 AM - VS Code: "Found 5 issues in 2 files. Review and fix?"
10:08 AM - You: Click "Fix All"
10:08 AM - VS Code: All issues fixed! ✅
```

**Total time:** 3 seconds of your time!

---

### Example 2: Without Auto-Sync (Still Automatic!)

```
10:00 AM - You: Write code, push to GitHub
10:08 AM - You: Remember to check CI
10:08 AM - You: Cmd+Shift+P → "Import CI Scan Results"
10:08 AM - VS Code: ⚙️ "Downloading..." (2 seconds)
10:08 AM - VS Code: "Found 5 issues. Review and fix?"
```

**Total time:** 5 seconds (no GitHub website needed!)

## 🔄 Fallback: Manual Import Still Available

If automatic download fails (e.g., no token, network error):

```
❌ Failed to download CI results: No GitHub token configured
   [Manual Import]
```

Click **"Manual Import"** → File picker opens → Select your downloaded JSON.

---

## 🔐 Security

**Q: Is my GitHub token safe?**  
A: Yes! It's:
- Stored securely in VS Code settings
- Only sent to `api.github.com` (GitHub's official API)
- Never shared with any third party
- Used with minimal permissions (`repo` + `read:actions`)

**Q: What can the token do?**  
A: Only:
- Read your repository info
- Read CI workflow results
- Download CI artifacts

**Cannot:**
- Modify code
- Delete anything
- Change settings
- Access other repos (only yours)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No GitHub token configured"
**Fix:** Run `Baseline Sentinel: Enable Auto-Sync (Polling)` to set up your token.

### "No Baseline Sentinel workflow runs found"
**Possible causes:**
1. CI hasn't run yet (push some code first)
2. Workflow name doesn't match (check `.github/workflows/*.yml`)
3. Workflow is still running (wait for completion)

**Fix:** Go to GitHub Actions page and verify a workflow completed.

### "No baseline-results artifact found"
**Cause:** The workflow didn't upload the artifact.  
**Fix:** Check your workflow YAML includes:
```yaml
- name: Upload Baseline Scan Results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: baseline-results
    path: baseline-results.json
```

### "Failed to download CI results: Network error"
**Fix:** Check your internet connection. Try manual import as fallback.
